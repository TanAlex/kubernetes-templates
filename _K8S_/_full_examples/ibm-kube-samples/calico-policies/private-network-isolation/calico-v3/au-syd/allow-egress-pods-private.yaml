# This policy opens port 53 for DNS, port 2049 for communication with NFS file servers,
# ports 443 and 3260 for communication to block storage, port 10250 for VPN communication,
# and port 2040 and 2041 on 172.20.0.0 for the master API server local proxy. It also
# allows pod access to other pods, denies access to private networks but allows access to
# public networks, and allows access in each zone of the region to the master.
